# Kaggle-Predicting-House-sales-prices
Ask a home buyer to describe their dream house, and they probably won't begin with the height of the basement ceiling or the proximity to an east-west railroad. But this playground competition's dataset proves that much more influences price negotiations than the number of bedrooms or a white-picket fence.

With **79 explanatory variables** describing almost every aspect of residential homes in Ames, Iowa, this competition results useful to try to predict the final price of each home by attempting to get the
most relevant features that influence the price.
